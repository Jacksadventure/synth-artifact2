; This section is used to define priorities between
; Image Modules. There are 2 modules managed by VISION:
; 1: Internal modules (in VISION's prg file)
; 2: zView LDG modules
; 3: zView SLB modules (not supported)
; Global defines a generic rule for all image formats
; Some examples:
; Global=2,1
; --> Prefer zView plugins to load images
; Global=1
; --> Only use VISION's internal modules to load images
; By default VISION will prefer its own modules and fall back to zView plugin if not supported
