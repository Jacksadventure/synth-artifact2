CIAlign Parameters files Path to input alignment file in FASTA format. Default None infile XXXXX Stem for output files ( including path ) . Default CIAlign outfile stem XXXXX Path to config file. inifile med stringent EvolvAGene.ini runtime Do not print progress to the screen. silent 0 all Use all available functions with default parameters. all 0 crop ends Crop the ends of sequences if they are poorly aligned. Default False crop ends 1 Minimum proportion of the sequence length ( excluding gaps ) that is the threshold for change in gap numbers. Default 0.05 crop ends mingap perc 0.02 Proportion of the sequence length ( excluding gaps ) that is being checked for change in gap numbers to redefine start/end.. Default 0.05 crop ends redefine perc 0.1 remove divergent Remove sequences with N proportion of positions at which the most common base / amino acid in the alignment is present. Default False remove divergent 1 Minimum proportion of positions which should be identical to the most common base / amino acid in order to be preserved. Default 0.75 remove divergent minperc 0.2 remove insertions Remove insertions found in 50 percent of sequences from the alignment. Default False remove insertions 1 Only remove insertions this number of residues. Default 3 insertion min size 3 Only remove insertions this number of residues. Default 300 insertion max size 100 Minimum number of bases on either side of an insertion to classify it as an insertion. Default 5 insertion min flank 5 remove short Remove sequences N bases / amino acids from the alignment. Default False remove short 0 Sequences are removed if they are shorter than this minimum length excluding gaps. Default 50 remove min length 50 keep gaponly Keep gap only columns in the alignment. Default True keep gaponly 1 consensus Make a consensus sequence based on the cleaned alignment. Default False make consensus 0 Type of consensus sequence to make - can be majority to use the most common character at each position in the consensus even if this is a gap or majority nongap to use the most common non-gap character at each position. Default majority consensus type majority nongap If there are gaps in the consensus ( if majority nongap is used as consensus type ) should these be included in the consensus ( True ) or should this position in the consensus be deleted ( False ) . Default False consensus keep gaps 0 Name to use for the consensus sequence in the output fasta file. Default consensus consensus name consensus mini alignments Plot a mini alignment - an image representing the input alignment. Default False plot input 0 Plot a mini alignment an image representing the output alignment. Default False plot output 0 Draws the input alignment but with the columns and rows which have been removed by each function marked up in corresponding colours. Default False plot markup 0 DPI for mini alignments. Default 300 plot dpi 300 Image format for mini alignments - can be png svg tiff or jpg. Default png plot format png Mini alignment width in inches. Default 5 plot width 5 Mini alignment height in inches. Default 3 plot height 3 sequence logosE Draw a sequence logo. Default False make sequence logo 0 Type of sequence logo - bar/text/both. Default bar sequence logo type bar DPI for sequence logo image. Default 300 sequence logo dpi 300 Font for text sequence logo. Default monospace sequence logo font monospace Number of bases / amino acids to show per row in the sequence logo where the logo is too large to show on a single line. Default 50 sequence logo nt per row 50 Image file type to use for the sequence logo - can be png svg tiff or jpg. Default png sequence logo filetype png Make a swatch showing available fonts. Default False list fonts only 0 coverage Plot the coverage of the input MSA. Default False plot coverage input 0 Plot the coverage of the output MSA. Default False plot coverage output 0 DPI for coverage plot. Default 300 plot coverage dpi 300 Height for coverage plot ( inches ) . Default 3 plot coverage height 3 Width for coverage plot ( inches ) . Default 5 plot coverage width 5 Colour for coverage plot ( hex code or name ) . Default 007 bf5 plot coverage colour 007 bf5 File type for coverage plot ( png svg tiff jpg ) . Default png plot coverage filetype png similarity matrix Make a similarity matrix for the input alignment. Default False make similarity matrix input 0 Make a similarity matrix for the output alignment. Default False make similarity matrix output 0 Number of decimal places to display in the similarity matrix output file. Default 4 make simmatrix dp 4 Minimum overlap between two sequences to have non-zero similarity in the similarity matqix. Default 1 make simmatrix minoverlap 1 Include positions with gaps in either or both sequences in the similarity matrix calculation. Default False make simmatrix keepgaps 0 unalign Generate a copy of the input alignment with no gaps. Default false unalign input 0 Generate a copy of the output alignment with no gaps. Default false unalign output 0 <EOF>
