This doesn't really seem like the type of school where people just walk up to each other and start conversations. Or maybe I'm just socially inept idk. Does anyone have any better ideas of how to start meeting new people?",

But honestly, you absolutely can just walk up to people and make friends. ppl play smash and gta on the second floor of student center, theres skaters at the greenspace.\n\nif you wait for people to approach you, you'll be disappointed. taking the first step is way easier once you get used to it.",

However, it might be helpful to get your foot out there. Once you start meeting people and they start introducing you to other people, you probably won\u2019t feel the need to keep using it either. It\u2019s just a good starting point, in my opinion.\n\nWhen you set your criteria, you can choose to only see people your age or your gender, etc. Of course when you meet people you should probably plan to meet in a group of at least 3 and meet up in the day time in a public setting. However, most of the people you\u2019ll see on there will probably be students just like you who are just looking for friends.",

I will say, if you\u2019re a freshman, a lot of people are in the same position you are. One way that I made friends was through my classes. You could always ask someone in your classes if they wanted to study together or something like that.",

For me it became a lot easier to meet good friends as you get into your major and share classes with a lot of the same people too semester after semester.
