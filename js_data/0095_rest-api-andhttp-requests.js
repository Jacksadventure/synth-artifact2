    What is and API

    - Application Program Interface
    - Contract provided by one piece of software to another
    - Structured request and response
    - We just work with an API that takes and request and responds with jokes

    Rest API's

    - Representational State Transfer
    - Architecture style for designing networked applications
    - Relies on stateless, client-server protocol, almost always HTTP
    - Treats server objects as resources that can be created or destroyed
    - Can be used by virtually any programming language
    - All Api's have their own rules and structure

    HTTP Request
    - GET : Retrieve data from a specified resource
    - POST: Submit data to be processed to a specified resource
    - PUT: Update a Specified Resource
    - HEAD: Same as get but does not return a body
    - OptionsL Returns the supported HTTP methods
    - PATH: Update partial resources
