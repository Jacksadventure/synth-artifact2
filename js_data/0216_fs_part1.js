// The file system (fs) module is a core Node.js module that provides a set of functions for
// interacting with the file system, allowing developers to perform various file-related operations such
// as reading, writing, updating, and deleting files. With fs, Node.js applications can manipulate files
// and directories, handle asynchronous file operations, and efficiently work with file streams, making
// it an essential module for building file-centric applications and managing data persistence in a
// server-side environment.
