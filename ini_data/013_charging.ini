# Configuration file for MCE - charging hysteresis control -*- mode: sh -*-
#
# Provided that battery kernel driver supports such operation,
# mce can be instructed for example to cease charging when battery
# level reaches 90% and restart charging when battery level drops
# below 50%.
#
# While mce side state logic and settings are generic, how charging
# is actually enabled/disabled can vary from one device type to
# another depending on hw and related kernel drivers.

# Devices with kernels that utilize
# - POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CHARGING_ENABLED
# - POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_INPUT_SUSPEND
# are detected automatically and do not need to be configured.
#
# If configuration data is present, it takes precedence over
# autodetect logic.

# Devices where kernel utilizes POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CHARGING_ENABLED
# For example: f5121 (Xperia X), l500d (Jolla C)

#ControlPath  = /sys/class/power_supply/battery/charging_enabled
#EnableValue  = 1
#DisableValue = 0

# Devices where kernel utilizes POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_INPUT_SUSPEND
# For example: h3113 (Xperia XA2), i4113 (Xperia 10)

#ControlPath  = /sys/class/power_supply/battery/input_suspend
#EnableValue  = 0
#DisableValue = 1
